# Fitness Tracker

Fitness tracker is an application which helps the users to track their workouts in an easy way. A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

They will also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they will be able to track the distance traveled.
